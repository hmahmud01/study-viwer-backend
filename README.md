Before going through the build guide follow the DB SETUP and Application Configuration guide first.

- Clone this repo first `https://github.com/hmahmud01/study-viwer-backend`
- cd to root project folder
- run this command `gradlew build`
- there will be a directory titled as build will be created inside root folder
- cd into build/libs
- a jar file will be createdi with the name StudyViewer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Project build steps completes here.

After Installing the driver make sure its running and follow the steps.

- create a user with the name "postgres" and set password "1234"
- create a database named "study"
- grant all priviledges to this db for user postgres

Database Setup step completes here. Follow the application configuration to connect the database to the application

## APPLICATION CONFIGURATION
Find the file application.properties inside `~/project-root/src/main/resources/application.properties`
Make sure the following properties are filled with appropriate values and configuration
- Fill up the data source url here `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/study` change the port address if there is any other port you prefer.
- set db username `spring.datasource.username=postgres` chanage the username here if there is any other username.
- set db password `spring.datasource.password=1234` change the password here if there is any other password or if there is none.

Project Configuration Completes here.
Now CD into project root folder. and follow the build guide already given earlier.
To run the application run this command `gradlew bootRun`

To run the jar file cd into the directory where the jar snapshot is located.(default url will be `~projectroot/build/libs`)
run the command `java -jar StudyViewer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## APPLICATION TEST GUIDE
- Find the file `StudyViewerApplicationTests` into `~/projectroot/src/test/java/com/example/StudyViewer`. If you are in IntelliJ IDEA, then right click over file and select run from the menu to run the tests. or open the test file and press `ctrl+shift+F10` to run the test command
- If you are from command line, then cd into project root folder and run `gradlew test` to get test test result of the project.

Both of these ways will result into similar output and the output will be saved in `~/projectroot/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`. Open that `index.html` file into browser to see the test results.
